# Study ETC

## What I used

1. Express.js, Docker, Docker Compose
   - I created two simple Express servers, built Docker images for each, and ran them using Docker Compose.
2. Express.js, Swagger UI (swagger-jsdoc, swagger-ui-express), OpenAPI Specification
   - I created a simple Express server with a CRUD controller, and wrote an OpenAPI specification for building a Swagger UI.
3. Node.js (npx), Docker (bat file), OpenAPI Generator
   - I used the OpenAPI specification created in step 2 and OpenAPI generator to create an axios factory to be used in the front-end.
